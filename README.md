# Microbloggos

This was a rush project to discover all the tools of MEAN. The goal was to recreate a micro-blogging API in three days.
I used this opportunity to take my first steps with Bootstrap. 

It was a fun project but I couldn't get through, so a lot of mocks are still in place, just to give a general idea. The registration and the login work, so does the token; neither the following options, nor the hashtag system were fully implemented.
